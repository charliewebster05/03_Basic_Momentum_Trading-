# 03_Basic_Momentum_Trading-
Here I developed a very basic rule-based momentum trading strategy that identifies and capitalises on short-term price trends using historical equity data.

The project uses 10 and 20 day moving average calculations in order to create buy and sell signals for a stock (I decided to use Palantir/PLTR), when the two moving averages fluctuated relative to one another.
